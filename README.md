Satellite-Based Boro Rice Monitoring System

## Objective
Develop a system to monitor Boro rice production across Bangladesh, providing data on production area and graphical statistics each season.

## Regions and Data
- Bangladesh divided into 7 regions.
- Production area calculated using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data.

## Approach
- Utilized remotely sensed MODIS data with **250m x 250m spatial resolution**.
- No ground truth data required.
- Analysis conducted over two distinct periods:
  - **Sowing season**: December 1 to January 10.
  - **Growing season**: January 11 to April 10.
- Data collected for **eight years (2008â€“2015)**.

## Methodology
- Applied an improvised Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) threshold for Boro rice area extraction.

## Features
- Provides **region-wise** and **area-wise** information.
- Includes search options for targeted data retrieval.
- Supports improvement/deterioration analysis.
- Offers a rice area extraction map view.

## Applications
- Designed for use by the Department of Agriculture and Food Ministry of Bangladesh.
- Provides accurate, up-to-date information for decision-making during:
  - Natural disasters.
  - Food security planning.
  - Policy formulation.

## Benefits
- Supports food security strategies.
- Enhances decision-making by providing ready access to production data.
- Useful for forecasting Boro rice yield.
